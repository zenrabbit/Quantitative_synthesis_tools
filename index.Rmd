# Critical skills for meta-analyses and systematic reviews      

![](./synthesis.png){width=3in}  

An overview of quantitative synthesis tools associated with review processing.

### Learning outcomes {-} 
1. Critically review peer-reviewed journal publications.  
2. Engineer syntheses and solutions from published evidence.  
3. Appreciate strengths of different synthesis tools and reporting.    
4. Do a meta-analysis or systematic review. 


### Rationale {-} 
Scientific synthesis of all academic evidence from data to papers can promote evidence-informed decision making. Every contemporary discipline has some capacity to support and benefit from synthesis tools. Here, we develop a set of heuristics to support innovation and leverage evidence.  

### Structure {-}  
A overview of lessons provided in this resource to encourage development and use of synthesis tools relevant to your discipline and challenges.
