\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Context}

To best explore conceptual and mental models for synthesis, a summary of the simple landscape of opportunities and more comprehensive mapping of synthesis and critical big-picture thinking in science is illuminating. Scientific synthesis is big picture science that describe a set of studies on a pinpointed topic (\href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00970.x}{Lortie 2014}). There are at least three simple and direct options that are amenable to a capture of the research associated with a scientific challenge that you have identified.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Narrative review as a highlight, short commentary, or new idea paper that is a snapshot of the key findings from a field research summarizing the main discoveries and/or listing the most critical research gaps. Papers like these are often called \textbf{Insights}, \textbf{Forum}, or \textbf{Ignite}.
\item
  Systematic reviews are similar to narrative reviews, but clear criteria are listed explaining how you selected papers, i.e.~these search terms were used in the Web of Science and only studies that had these key inclusion attributes were used. Systematic are more replicable because others can follow your steps and get the same set of papers and hopefully reach similar conclusions about the corpus of evidence. These reviews also typically provide some simple quantitative data about the set of studies such as number of countries where the research was done, total sample sizes, number of variables examined, or any attributes that describe what the research was for a specific detail. The narrative component is similar to the first option because it can state what we know and what do not but these reviews do so \emph{much} more precisely. Even a few numbers go a long way to convincing people about the extent that we know or have studied a subject in science. Papers like these are often termed \textbf{Short Commentary} or \textbf{Mini-Review}.
\item
  Meta-analyses are systematic reviews plus for each primary study you summarize, you capture the relative efficacy of the treatment tested. Papers like this are often termed \textbf{Reviews} or \textbf{Meta-analyses} but other terms can be used too. Note: in some fields of research the terms `systematic review' and `meta-analysis' are used interchangeably, but in most environmental sciences, meta-analyses always have a measure of the strength of evidence from each studied included in the synthesis whilst systematic reviews typically do not.
\end{enumerate}

So for instance, narrative review might provide insights into vaccine research and report that we have tested three vaccine types but need to test more alternatives. A systematic review would state this too but mention how they checked the science, i.e.~we checked 100 papers using these terms x,y, \& z in The Web of Science, and it might also state how many people were tested in total across all studies. This is a more powerful synthesis. However, the gold standard would be the meta-analysis that summarizes all of the above but also reports how well each vaccine type tested actually works on average across all the studies.

\hypertarget{summary-of-options}{%
\subsubsection*{Summary of options}\label{summary-of-options}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Summary of options}

\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
synthesis & elements & benefits & limitations\\
\midrule
narrative review & summary, insights, next steps & more opinion, can be shorter, less detailed processing the research literature & can be less compelling without some specific evidence listed and is difficult to repeat\\
systematic review & summary, insights, next steps, explanation of how studies were selected in the review, can have counts of ideas tested & more specific, can be repeated, and can be more compelling & need to keep track of how you selected papers, need to sort through papers in more detail in addition to capturing main ideas\\
meta-analyses & all of above possible but must also include an assessment of the strength of evidence of each study included in the synthesis & gold standard, reader can get a sense of how effective a treatment or intervention is relative to another & need to extract means or measures of efficacy with sample sizes or variance from each study\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\hypertarget{evidence-framing}{%
\subsubsection*{Evidence framing}\label{evidence-framing}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Evidence framing}

A more complex and comprehensive summary of the contemporary landscape of synthesis has been evolving. Framing scientific synthesis activities as an open, comprehensive, and diverse aggregation or summary of many forms of evidence expands our capacity to inform decision making. Contemporary synthesis science has innovated on evidence maps as a tool to show the evidence. This can be done through mapping evidence onto a geographic map to show where we know what we know (\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/528185a}{McKinnon et al.~2015}). Evidence maps can also be less literal and map out knowledge as tabular or bubble plots that focus more on the relative frequencies of what we know about different concepts within a synthesis (\href{https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-016-0204-x}{Miake-Ley et al.~2016}). This approach has also been framed as `evidence maps for evidence gaps' because it can become abundantly clear where evidence is missing in terms of research or ideas (\href{https://environmentalevidencejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0096-9}{O'Leary et al.~2017}). Importantly, decision making has also evolved to more substantially rely on synthesis science to inform strategy (\href{https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.426}{Thomas-Walters et al.~2021}). There has also been a drive to thus enable and support more synthesis to build capacity and connect disparate fields of research for more holistic solution sets (\href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rec.13251}{Ladouceur and Shackelford 2021}).

\subsection*{Context}\label{context-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Context}

Evidence implementation and reuse is a non-trivial process in most disciplines. It is crucial that experts are able to use, reuse, and implement synthesis findings. This process of critical appraisal furthers a novel, big-picture view of scientific findings associated with single studies. This can take the form of a perspective that routinely weights relative evidence by purpose, reason, and other findings to improve decision making by stakeholders, the public, and other scientists. Application of this process to published peer-review evidence can be limited by transparency, level of reporting, missing data, meta-data articulation, and limited moderator reporting. Hence, ten simple rules for evidence reuse were proposed were broadly to highlight these and other challenges in synthesis science (\href{https://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/10.1139/facets-2020-0021}{Lortie and Owen 2020}). Critical reading of meta-analyses is also a powerful skill for all experts (\href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jrsm.1109}{Lortie et al.~2013}). This thinking and evaluation process has also been developed into a more prescriptive set of ten questions to apply to any published meta-analysis or systematic review (\href{https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-017-0357-7}{Nakagawa et al.~2017}). These questions strengthen the reuse of current meta-analyses and provide a checklist for reporting in future systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Good reporting is supported by good thinking. Purpose prevails. A primer for systematic reviews and meta-analysis in the sports science clearly articulates a clear and direct purpose delineation process for syntheses (\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3474302/}{Impellizzeri and Bizzini 2021}).

\item

  Auditing the quality of existing trials.
\end{enumerate}

Collectively, these how-to papers suggest that it would be ideal if synthesis reporting exceeded the norms and standards associated with primary research reporting to enable next-level synthesis and reproducibility. Nonetheless, it is easy to get lost in the technical details. Consequently, purpose, audience, and reuse should be kept at the forefront of reviewing, reporting, and doing scientific syntheses. These ideas can be mobilized for knowledge mining even in the early steps of evidence retrieval and reviewing for inclusion in a synthesis project.

Try out these ideas in a meta-analysis. Securing derived data to replicate an existing synthesis was not common historically, but it is now becoming increasingly viable with open science influences on these contributions. How to do a meta-analysis is well described in the peer-reviewed literature (\href{https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1348/000711010X502733}{Field and Gillett 2010}) and numerous books (\href{https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691137285/handbook-of-meta-analysis-in-ecology-and-evolution}{Koricheva et al 2013}) to name a few. Doing meta-analyses using the R programming language is similarly well articulated - particularly from the documentation associated with the package \href{https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php}{metafor}. There are no bad choices in R with well over 100 packages associated with and supporting meta-analyses (\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MetaAnalysis.html}{conservatively listed at 151 packages}. The output of Stata (an application specific to many medical meta-analyses), the R package meta, and metafor were virtually identical in several test cases (\href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.6747}{Lortie and Filazzola 2020}). Ten criteria are proposed in contrasting R packages for this task specifically, but at the current time, metafor is the most commonly used and extensively documented. Hence, consider tackling the challenges here with this package as a robust starting point and entry in meta-statistics.

Interpreting meta-analyses and systematic reviews effectively and fairly is critical for the advancement of scientific theory. Conceptual and methodological developments in many fields currently rely on syntheses to evaluate the relative merit of contrasting options (\href{https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/70/11/1005/5908035}{Halpern et al 2020}). Importantly however, meta-analyses can fail (\href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.960316.x}{Kotiaho and Tomkins 2002}). The \textbf{representativeness} of the evidence is crucial because the intent and purpose of the primary studies should in principle align with the purpose of the synthesis (as discussed previously). The \textbf{selection process} for evidence and the statistics can introduce \textbf{biases} and lead to potential spurious interpretations of the relevance of a hypothesis for instance. Failure to find support for a hypothesis does not necessarily mean that this is not a conceptually valid endeavor or that it does not explain the functioning of a specific system. Sparse evidence or \textbf{publication biases} can skew negative results in meta-analyses and lead to erroneous interpretations because of the evidence. What we know about the world (or the functioning of the world) may not match what we know about the science about the world. However, support for hypotheses in spite of biases and evidence limitations is likely to be representative of the underlying processes and patterns in a system. Consequently, meta-analyses can be evaluated, at times based on evidence volume, as more one-sided versus two-sided tests of concepts or methods. Heterogeneity and moderator analyses will also temper the assessment capacity for a meta-analysis to succeed in functioning as a knowledge engineering tool.

Evaluation and use of meta-analyses is relevant to society at large. Controversy can be resolved or obfuscated by these syntheses (\href{https://www.science.org/news/2018/09/meta-analyses-were-supposed-end-scientific-debates-often-they-only-cause-more}{De Vrieze 2018}). Two key factors play into the public reuse arena. The interpretation process and the relative strength of the derived evidence between syntheses that diverge in their conclusions. The collision of ideas can be exacerbated when synthesist scientists do not transparently and clearly report findings. This can be further magnified when the media and others directly reuse a published meta-analysis. The other factor, strength of evidence, must be transparently and accurately handled within each meta-analysis by better reporting. Lack of supporting derived data and inadequate reporting of the study populations (of papers) that comprise contrasting meta-analyses impede quantitative contrasts of syntheses. Description of the differences between studies within a synthesis is foundational to a better mapping of science onto `truth' (\href{https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124}{Ioannidis 2005}). We must set a higher standard for synthesis reporting and adopt more open science components into these projects. Finally, education and discussion within a synthesis of how well that specific process functioned in summarizing an evidence hierarchy must be developed.
